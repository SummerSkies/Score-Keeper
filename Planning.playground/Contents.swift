import UIKit

/*
 To-Dos:
 
 All of the code is a mess -- straighten everything up before pushing forward or you'll never make any progress.
 
 -USE POLISHES TO STOP CRASHES: your code only works if the info passed has all of its required info; Don't allow the user to save anything if it does not.
 
 -No Winner Yet is never shown because score defaults to 0
    
 
 Future Polishes:
 -Test keyboards on player detail view
 -Disable save button on deail view if applicable
 -Fix disabling steppers on player list (so it is not diabled from first run)
 -Replace all preparefor:(segue) funcs with IBSegueActions (SIMPLIFIY- I'm like 90% sure you have like 80x the amount of segue stuff than you need
 -make default cells for if no players or games have been created yet
 -Default winner view if no winner exists
 -Animate title change on the custom edit button
 -Rename everything to be clearer:
    -But to what?
